# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

In this project I implemented an image classification application. This application trained a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It used the trained model to classify new images. Firstly, I developed the code in a Jupyter notebook to ensure training implementation works well. Then, I converted the code into a Python application that run from the command line of system.
